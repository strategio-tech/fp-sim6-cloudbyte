<h2>Important Notice</h2>
<p>Please refer to the repository in the link below for the complete project with the cyclic github hooks setup.</p>
<p>https://github.com/chomiak89/fp-sim6-cloudbyte</p>

 <h2>MongoDB </h2>
 <p>Due to scalability, manageability and dynamic schemas, MongoDB has been used as the database for the application. Users, cafes and comments are stored in the cloud hosted MongoDB Atlas solution.</p>
 
<h2>Node.js/Express</h2>
<p>By implementing Express and Mongoose, we established a connection between the frontend and our MongoDB database, and defined the functionality of the APIs.  </p>
 
<h2>React</h2>
<p> React is used for the frontend. Hooks are used for data propagation, API calls, Prop management, and Conditional rendering among other functionalities.</p>

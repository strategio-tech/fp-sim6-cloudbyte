# Requirements      
 <p><h1>MongoDB </h1></p>
 <p>Utilizing Mongoose, we connect to MongoDB to store all information about the users, such as username, password, email and so, also to keep track of comments and     cafes.</p>
 
<p><h1>Node.js/Express</h1></p>
<p>By implementing Express and Mongoose, we established a connection between the frontend and our MongoDB database, and defined the functionality of the APIs.  </p>
 
<p><h1>React</h1></p>
<p> For the frontend, we use React. React Hooks were used to dynamically. The application has been separated into multiple different components to enhance organization and maintainability.</p>
      
      
# Process for creating, designing, and maintaining software applications.
